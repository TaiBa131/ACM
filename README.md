# Adaptive Classroom Manager
This is my first real Github / MAIOU Project, it'll be used to coordinate my (*also*) first ever "*Maîtrise d'ouvrage*" project.

**Adaptive Classroom Manager**, or ACM, is the original name of my first ever "Maîtrise d'ouvrage" project.
The principal idea is an IOT device that can detect the state of the classroom and report that state to some authority; for the MAIOU project, its mostly a Proof of Concept, so there are ideas and features that will not be implemented, but theoretically could be in the future.

I'll be using an Arduino for the project, mainly an Uno because of the dynamic memory (RAM) limitations on the Nano, even though I'll try, the main limitation are the external libraries e.g. for the ENC28J60 chip

I might try working with different branches, but the main one will surely be for the Arduino Uno.
